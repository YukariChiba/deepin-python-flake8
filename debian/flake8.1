.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBflake8\fP is a command\-line utility for enforcing style consistency across
Python projects. By default it includes lint checks provided by the PyFlakes
project, PEP\-0008 inspired style checks provided by the PyCodeStyle project,
and McCabe complexity checking provided by the McCabe project. It will also
run third\-party extensions if they are found and installed.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
show program's version number and exit
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
show this help message and exit
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
print more information about what is happening in
flake8. This option is repeatable and will increase
verbosity each time it is repeated.
.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
report only file names, or nothing. This option is
repeatable.
.TP
\fB\-\-count\fR
print total number of errors and warnings to standard
error and set the exit code to 1 if total is not
empty.
.TP
\fB\-\-diff\fR
report changes only within line number ranges in the
unified diff provided on standard in by the user.
.TP
\fB\-\-exclude\fR=\fI\,patterns\/\fR
comma\-separated list of files or directories to
exclude. (Default:
\&.svn,CVS,.bzr,.hg,.git,__pycache__,.tox,.eggs,*.egg)
.TP
\fB\-\-filename\fR=\fI\,patterns\/\fR
only check for filenames matching the patterns in this
comma\-separated list. (Default: *.py)
.TP
\fB\-\-stdin\-display\-name\fR=\fI\,STDIN_DISPLAY_NAME\/\fR
the name used when reporting errors from code passed
via stdin. This is useful for editors piping the file
contents to flake8. (Default: stdin)
.TP
\fB\-\-format\fR=\fI\,format\/\fR
format errors according to the chosen formatter.
.TP
\fB\-\-hang\-closing\fR
hang closing bracket instead of matching indentation
of opening bracket's line.
.TP
\fB\-\-ignore\fR=\fI\,errors\/\fR
comma\-separated list of errors and warnings to ignore
(or skip). For example, \fB\-\-ignore\fR=E4,E51,W234.
(Default: E121,E123,E126,E226,E24,E704,W503,W504)
.TP
\fB\-\-max\-line\-length\fR=\fI\,n\/\fR
maximum allowed line length for the entirety of this
run. (Default: 79)
.TP
\fB\-\-select\fR=\fI\,errors\/\fR
comma\-separated list of errors and warnings to enable.
For example, \fB\-\-select\fR=E4,E51,W234. (Default: E,F,W,C90)
.TP
\fB\-\-disable\-noqa\fR
disable the effect of "# noqa". This will report
errors on lines with "# noqa" at the end.
.TP
\fB\-\-show\-source\fR
show the source generate each error or warning.
.TP
\fB\-\-statistics\fR
count errors and warnings.
.TP
\fB\-\-enable\-extensions\fR=\fI\,ENABLE_EXTENSIONS\/\fR
enable plugins and extensions that are otherwise
disabled by default
.TP
\fB\-\-exit\-zero\fR
exit with status code "0" even if there are errors.
.TP
\fB\-\-install\-hook\fR=\fI\,INSTALL_HOOK\/\fR
install a hook that is run prior to a commit for the
supported version control system.
.TP
\fB\-j\fR \fIJOBS\fR, \fB\-\-jobs\fR=\fI\,JOBS\/\fR
number of subprocesses to use to run checks in
parallel. This is ignored on Windows. The default,
"auto", will auto\-detect the number of processors
available to use. (Default: auto)
.TP
\fB\-\-output\-file\fR=\fI\,OUTPUT_FILE\/\fR
redirect report to a file.
.TP
\fB\-\-tee\fR
write to stdout and output\-file.
.TP
\fB\-\-append\-config\fR=\fI\,APPEND_CONFIG\/\fR
provide extra config files to parse in addition to the
files found by Flake8 by default. These files are the
last ones read and so they take the highest precedence
when multiple files provide the same option.
.TP
\fB\-\-config\fR=\fI\,CONFIG\/\fR
path to the config file that will be the authoritative
config source. This will cause Flake8 to ignore all
other configuration files.
.TP
\fB\-\-isolated\fR
ignore all found configuration files.
.TP
\fB\-\-benchmark\fR
print benchmark information about this run of Flake8
.TP
\fB\-\-max\-complexity\fR=\fI\,MAX_COMPLEXITY\/\fR
McCabe complexity threshold
.TP
\fB\-\-bug\-report\fR
print information necessary when preparing a bug report
.TP
\fB\-\-builtins\fR=\fI\,BUILTINS\/\fR
define more built\-ins, comma separated
.TP
\fB\-\-doctests\fR
check syntax of the doctests
.TP
\fB\-\-include\-in\-doctest\fR=\fI\,INCLUDE_IN_DOCTEST\/\fR
run doctests only on these files
.TP
\fB\-\-exclude\-from\-doctest\fR=\fI\,EXCLUDE_FROM_DOCTEST\/\fR
